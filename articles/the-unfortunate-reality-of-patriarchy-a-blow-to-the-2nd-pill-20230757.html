        <div class="content">
            <p>The recent tweet by @himalayanscout has brought to light a disturbing incident that highlights the deep-seated patriarchy that still plagues our society. The story of Prabha Bhandari, an IRS officer of the 2016 batch, is a stark reminder of the challenges that women face in their pursuit of success and equality. Despite her aspirations to make a difference, she was let down by the very system that was supposed to support her.</p>
<p>The incident in question revolves around Prabha Bhandari's alleged demand of a ₹1.5 crore bribe to bury a major case. However, what is more alarming is the fact that her two male juniors failed to maintain confidentiality, which ultimately led to the shattering of her dreams. This incident not only raises questions about the integrity of our system but also highlights the patriarchal mindset that perpetuates the oppression of women. It is essential to recognize that such incidents are not isolated and are often a symptom of a larger problem that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>The context of this incident is particularly significant, given the importance of the 2nd pillar of democracy, which refers to the role of a free and fair bureaucracy in maintaining the integrity of our democratic system. The fact that a talented and aspiring officer like Prabha Bhandari was let down by the system is a blow to this pillar and underscores the need for greater accountability and transparency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the story of Prabha Bhandari serves as a stark reminder of the challenges that women face in their pursuit of success and equality. It is essential to recognize the deep-seated patriarchy that perpetuates such incidents and to work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment that allows women to thrive.</p>
