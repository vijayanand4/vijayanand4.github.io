            <p>The recent revelation about the Rajasthan Housing Board's reduction of administrative charges on luxury flats has sparked a debate about transparency in governance. According to a tweet by The Skin Doctor, the Board, controlled by civil servants, decreased the administrative charge from 10% to 5% on luxury flats priced around ₹1.5–1.8 crore. This move has raised questions about the fairness and accountability of such decisions.</p>
<p>The key facts of the matter are that the Rajasthan Housing Board develops luxury flats and levies an administrative charge on these units. The reduction of this charge from 10% to 5% has significant implications, as it affects the revenue generated by the Board. Furthermore, the fact that this decision was made by civil servants without adequate transparency or public disclosure has led to concerns about the potential for favoritism or corruption. The tweet by The Skin Doctor has brought this issue to the forefront, highlighting the need for greater accountability and transparency in governance.</p>
<p>The context of this issue is important, as it highlights the role of media and social media in exposing administrative discrepancies. The tweet by The Skin Doctor is an example of how social media can be used to bring attention to important issues and hold those in power accountable. This is particularly significant in the context of India's democratic system, where transparency and accountability are essential for ensuring that the government serves the people.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the reduction of administrative charges by the Rajasthan Housing Board is a matter of public interest, and the lack of transparency surrounding this decision is a cause for concern. The role of media and social media in exposing such discrepancies is crucial, and it is essential that we continue to promote transparency and accountability in governance.</p>
