            <p>India's decision to ban the import of waste tyres for burning in 2022 was hailed as a significant step towards reducing pollution and protecting the environment. However, a recent investigation has uncovered a shocking truth - despite the ban, India has been importing five times more waste tyres, making it the world's furnace for this hazardous waste.</p>
<p>The investigation, led by reporters from the Reporters Collective, has tracked the entire illegal supply chain, from the port of entry to the furnaces where these tyres are burned, releasing toxic fumes into the atmosphere. The findings reveal a blatant disregard for the ban and a lack of effective enforcement, allowing the illicit trade to thrive. Key facts from the investigation include the massive scale of imports, with millions of tonnes of waste tyres being brought into the country, and the devastating impact on the environment and public health.</p>
<p>The context of this issue is critical, as India is already struggling to manage its waste management crisis. The country's rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to a significant increase in waste generation, and the lack of adequate infrastructure to manage this waste has resulted in severe environmental and health consequences. The illicit waste tyre trade is just one aspect of this larger problem, highlighting the need for more effective policies and enforcement mechanisms to protect the environment and public health.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the revelation of India's illicit waste tyre trade is a wake-up call for the government and citizens alike. It is essential to take immediate action to address this issue and ensure that the ban on waste tyre imports is enforced effectively. By doing so, India can reduce its environmental footprint and protect the health and well-being of its citizens.</p>
