            <p>The recent tweet by @Being_Humor highlights the frustration of dealing with corrupt organizations, in this case, BSNL. The tweet reveals how the user was constantly harassed by the company despite clearing all dues and disconnecting their service. This experience is not unique, and many individuals have faced similar issues with various institutions. The fact that the user had to take to social media to resolve the issue raises important questions about the effectiveness of traditional complaint redressal systems.</p>
<p>The main issue here is the lack of accountability and transparency within institutions like BSNL. Despite being a public sector undertaking, the company's actions seem to be driven by a desire to extract money from customers rather than provide quality service. The fact that the user received messages for two years despite clearing all dues is a clear indication of the company's inefficiency and corruption. Social media platforms have become a crucial tool for holding such institutions accountable, as seen in this case where the user's tweet led to a resolution.</p>
<p>The context of this issue is significant, as it highlights the importance of social media in promoting transparency and accountability. In today's digital age, social media platforms have become an essential pillar of democracy, allowing citizens to express themselves and hold institutions accountable. The #2ndPillarOfDemocracy tweet is a testament to the power of social media in bringing about change and promoting good governance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the tweet by @Being_Humor serves as a reminder of the need for institutions to be more transparent and accountable. Social media platforms have emerged as a powerful tool for promoting good governance and holding institutions accountable. As citizens, it is essential to leverage these platforms to bring about positive change and ensure that institutions serve the people rather than their own interests.</p>
