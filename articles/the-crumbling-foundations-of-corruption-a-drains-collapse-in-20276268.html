        <div class="content">
            <p>The recent collapse of a drain under construction in Danapur, Bihar, has sent shockwaves across the nation, highlighting the deep-seated issue of corruption in India's infrastructure development. The fact that the drain failed to survive even its completion phase is a stark reminder of the subpar quality of work being carried out in the country. This incident has sparked widespread outrage, with many taking to social media to express their discontent and frustration with the system.</p>
<p>The collapse of the drain is a classic example of how corruption can manifest in the most unexpected ways. The Nalanda Index's tweet aptly sums up the situation, stating that the drain's collapse is a testament to the rampant corruption plaguing the country's infrastructure development sector. It is appalling to think that a structure meant to serve the public failed to withstand even the initial stages of construction. This raises serious questions about the quality of materials used, the expertise of the contractors, and the level of oversight exercised by the authorities.</p>
<p>The context of this incident is equally disturbing, as it highlights the lack of accountability and transparency in the system. The fact that such a structure could be built and collapse without anyone being held accountable is a stark reminder of the flaws in the country's governance framework. It is imperative that the authorities take immediate action to address this issue and ensure that those responsible are brought to book.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the collapse of the drain in Danapur, Bihar, is a wake-up call for the nation to take a closer look at the corruption plaguing its infrastructure development sector. It is time for the authorities to take concrete steps to address this issue and ensure that the public's trust is restored. Only then can we hope to build a stronger, more resilient India.</p>
